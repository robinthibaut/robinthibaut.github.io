## Imaging Saltwater Intrusion in Vietnam

This study applied **electrical resistivity tomography (ERT)** to investigate saltwater intrusion in the **Luy River coastal aquifer** in Binh Thuan Province, Vietnam.

### Project Overview

Coastal aquifers worldwide face increasing pressure from saltwater intrusion due to over-extraction and sea-level rise. This collaborative study between Belgian and Vietnamese researchers aimed to characterize the extent of saltwater intrusion using geophysical methods.

### Key Findings

- **21 ERT profiles** revealed a substantially larger intrusion zone than previously recognized
- High-resolution imaging of the freshwater-saltwater interface
- Improved understanding of local hydrogeological conditions

### Methodology

The study employed:
- **Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT)**: Non-invasive geophysical imaging
- **2D inversion techniques**: Processing and interpretation of resistivity data
- **Hydrogeological integration**: Combining geophysical results with local geology

### Impact

This work provides:
- **Critical baseline data** for groundwater management
- **Methodology** applicable to other coastal regions
- **Open-access publication** for the international community

### Publication

Published in **Water** (MDPI) as an open-access article, making the findings freely available to researchers and practitioners worldwide.
