## TURBEAMS: 3D Turbidity Mapping

**TURBEAMS** (Towards 3D turbidity by correlating multibeam sonar and in-situ sensor data) is a national research project aimed at developing innovative methods for **3D turbidity and suspended particulate matter (SPM) imaging** in aquatic environments.

### Project Overview

This BELSPO-funded project (New RV Belgica program) combines **multibeam sonar technology** with **machine learning** to create high-resolution 3D maps of water quality parameters.

### My Contribution

During my postdoctoral research at Ghent University (2023), I contributed to the project by:

- **Deep Learning Model Development**: Built neural networks linking multibeam water-column backscatter with turbidity/SPM measurements
- **Data Processing Optimization**: Scaled data handling to process millions of acoustic data points per survey session
- **Python Workflow Development**: Created efficient data flows aligned with the project's 3D imaging objectives

### Technical Innovation

The project represents a significant advancement in:

- **Acoustic-Optical Data Fusion**: Combining multibeam sonar with in-situ optical sensors
- **Real-time Processing**: Developing workflows for near real-time turbidity mapping
- **3D Visualization**: Creating volumetric representations of water quality parameters

### Impact

This work supports:
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Enhanced capabilities for tracking sediment transport and water quality
- **Marine Science**: New tools for understanding aquatic ecosystem dynamics
- **Maritime Operations**: Improved navigation and dredging support

### Collaboration

The project involves multiple Belgian institutions and represents a collaborative effort to advance marine technology and environmental monitoring capabilities.
