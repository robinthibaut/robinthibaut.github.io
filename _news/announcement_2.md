I am delighted to share the news that Ty Ferré, Distinguished Professor in the Department of Hydrology and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Arizona, will be giving a public lecture at Ghent University on the 21st of February, 2023 from 2pm to 4pm.

The lecture is entitled ‘The Limits of Science - How Hydrogeology Is Succeeding and Failing Society and What We Can Do about It’.

Professor Ferré will present an overview of the state of the practice in hydrogeologic analyses, highlighting exciting new efforts to improve our analyses. He will also point to why these advances are not sufficient to ensure that science is doing as much as it can to support water-resources decision-making. Finally, Professor Ferré will touch on the opportunities and challenges presented by the emergence of Machine Learning to including these concepts in hydrogeologic analyses.

Following the public lecture, there will be an open discussion and interested PhD students are invited to register in advance to plan a 1-to-1 discussion with Ty Ferré.

Don't pass up this opportunity to hear from a renowned expert on this important and timely topic!
