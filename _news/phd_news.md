I'm thrilled to announce that I've just defended my PhD thesis, and am now officially a Doctor of Philosophy in Hydrogeology and Applied Geology!

Thanks a million to Thomas Hermans for his mentorship, guidance and support throughout these years, as well as to my co-promoter Eric Laloy, the members of the jury Ellen Van De Vijver, Kristine Walraevens, Frédéric Nguyen and Ty Ferré, and the Chair Stephen Louwye. 

You can find my thesis at the following [link](https://robinthibaut.github.io/assets/pdf/robin_thibaut_2023_dissertation.pdf).

I’m grateful to everyone who has helped me reach this milestone and I look forward to continue doing what I love – research!
