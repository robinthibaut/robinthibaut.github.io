🌍

Thrilled to share that I’ve joined Zanskar Geothermal & Minerals as a Computational Geoscientist in Salt Lake City, Utah. I’ll be focusing on data assimilation, modeling, and optimization to reduce costs in geothermal exploration. Looking forward to this new chapter and connecting with others in renewable energy!
