Hello everyone! 🌍

I am thrilled to announce that I've embarked on a new adventure, relocating from the charming landscapes of Belgium to the dynamic and vibrant city of Berkeley. I'm now working at the renowned Berkeley Lab, and I'm absolutely elated to be here.

The view from my new place is nothing short of breathtaking, as you can see in the attached picture. Overlooking the vast cityscape with the iconic San Francisco skyline in the distance, it's a daily reminder of the exciting journey ahead.

The blend of academia, culture, and nature here is unique, and I can't wait to dive deep into the myriad of experiences Berkeley has to offer.
