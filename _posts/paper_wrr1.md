## Comparing Well and Geophysical Data for Temperature Monitoring Within a Bayesian Experimental Design Framework

Our new research paper was just published in Water Resources Research https://lnkd.in/eh6VgaqW

We used Bayesian Evidential Learning (BEL) to optimize the design of a 4D temperature field monitoring experiment. We demonstrated how BEL can take into account various data source combinations (temperature logs combined with geophysical data) in the Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED). To determine the optimal data source combination, we used the RMSE of the predicted target in the low dimensional latent space where BEL is solving the prediction problem.

The code used for this publication is, as always, open-source and can be found at https://lnkd.in/g79C644.

The dataset and notebooks used to reproduce the results are also available on Kaggle: https://lnkd.in/eQFPPFfb.
