I am a PhD Fellow at Ghent University, Belgium. 
My research focuses on developing a new framework for experimental design in earth sciences under a Bayesian approach. 
I have experience in marine geophysical surveys, near-surface geophysics and coding. 
My research interests include Bayesian statistics, geostatistics, image processing, data science, and machine learning. 
I am interested in applying these methods to a variety of problems in environmental sciences and earth sciences.
Contact me if you want to discuss a project or collaborate on one involving the application of machine learning in the geosciences.
