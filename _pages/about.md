I am a postdoc researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the Watershed Function Scientific Focus Area.
My research interests include Bayesian statistics, geostatistics, image processing, data science, and machine learning. 
I am interested in applying these methods to a variety of problems in environmental sciences and earth sciences.
Contact me if you want to discuss a project or collaborate on one involving the application of machine learning in the geosciences.
